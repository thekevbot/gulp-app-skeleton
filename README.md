#Generic App Skeleton
This is my app skeleton for setting up a new app project. It uses Gulp + BrowserSync to spin up a simple server and watches for changes to your HTML/SCSS/JS files.

To get started, clone this repo and run:

````
npm install
````

To start watching your files, run:

````
gulp watch
````

This will start watching for changes to your .scss, .js, and .html files.
